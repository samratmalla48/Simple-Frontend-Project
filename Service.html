          <h3>Welcome To Our Site</h3>
          <p>
            I am Ben Carling, the owner and head coach at Sports Performance
            Services Ltd, based in Douglas, Isle of Man. After studying business
            management, I decided embark in a career that was also a passion of
            mine; health and fitness. I had played sports from an early age so
            it seemed a natural thing to do. I became a qualified Personal
            Trainer, and latterly an accredited Strength and Conditioning coach
            with the UKSCA. Currently there are only 4 accredited coaches in the
            Isle of Man, and circa 600 in the UK
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as private work, I work at the Isle of Man Sport Institute.
            I work with a wide cross section of athletes from different sports,
            from field based sports such as football, rugby and hockey to
            individual sports such as archery, sailing, tennis, motorsport and
            swimming. I am proud to have played my part in helping these
            athletes set personal bests, Island records and some that have gone
            on to achieve scholarships or youth contracts at professional level.
          </p>
